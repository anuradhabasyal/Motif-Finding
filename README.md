# DNA Motif Finding and Sequence Analysis

This project provides a collection of Python functions for analyzing DNA and RNA sequences. The implemented functions perform various operations such as finding motifs, calculating Hamming distances, translating RNA sequences into proteins, and working with introns and exons.

## Features

- **Hamming Distance**: Calculate the Hamming distance between two DNA strings.
- **Translation**: Convert an RNA sequence into its corresponding protein sequence.
- **Motif Finding**: Identify all occurrences of a DNA motif within a larger DNA sequence.
- **RNA Splicing**: Remove introns from a DNA string and translate the remaining exons into a protein sequence.
- **Longest Common Substring**: Find the longest common substring among multiple DNA sequences.
- **Finding Subsequences**: Locate the positions where one string appears as a subsequence in another.
- **Longest Common Subsequence**: Determine the longest common subsequence between two DNA strings.
- **Shortest Common Supersequence**: Compute the shortest common supersequence of two DNA strings.

## Project Structure

- **Code**: All functions are defined in a single Python script.
- **Documentation**: Each function includes detailed docstrings describing its purpose, input arguments, return values, and potential exceptions.
